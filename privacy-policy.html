        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Q: How do I delete a story?</strong><br>
        A: On the home screen, tap the trash icon on any story card. You'll be asked to confirm twice to prevent accidental deletion.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: Can I edit my stories?</strong><br>
        A: Yes! Open any story and tap the Edit button (pencil icon) in the top right. You can edit text, delete lines, remove images, and even change the title.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: How do I export my stories?</strong><br>
        A: Finish a story by tapping the checkered flag icon. Once finished, you'll see PDF and Audio export options on the home screen for that story.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: Why isn't the AI responding?</strong><br>
        A: Make sure you have an internet connection. The AI needs to connect to our servers to generate stories and images. If problems persist, try again in a minute.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Q: Is my data safe?</strong><br>
        A: Yes! All your stories are stored privately on your device. We don't collect or store your personal information.</p>
